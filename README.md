### Hi 😄

#### I am an undergraduate  Computer Engineering student. My passion for solving Artificial Intelligence problems brought me to spend most of my time on researching in Deep and Machine Learning area. 

The most valuable lesson I have learnt in the last year is fundamental theories in Computing Intelligence and ML/DL algorithms. Since then, I found my way toward future!

This semester I have learnt Learning Libraries for Python([Numpy](https://numpy.org), [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [Keras](https://keras.io)) and libraries for data visualization. Currently, I'm continuing to build more skills in working with these libraries by doing researches with my supervisors. The following summer(2021), I hope to complete a research internship program that will provide real-life experience and important technological skills.
