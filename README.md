### Hi 😄

#### 
I am currently a senior undergraduate computer engineering student at Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran. My research interests include **Deep Learning** in particular, and **Machine Learning** in general, with applications in **Computer Vision**, and **Graph Learning**. I am intended to better understand these methods in a principled manner by investigating their underlying mathematics and their practical implications in real life. My research goal is to channel such better theoretical and functional understanding of these new methods towards better practical solutions for real life problems.
