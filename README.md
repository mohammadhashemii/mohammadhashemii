### Hi Folks 😄

#### I am the third-year Computer Engineering student, future Data Scientist:)M y passion for solving Artificial Intelligence problems brought me to spend most of my time on researching in Deep and Machine Learning area. 

The most valuable lesson I have learnt in the last year is fundamental theories in Computing Intelligence and ML/DL algorithms. Since then, I found my way toward future!

This semester I have learnt Learning Libraries for Python([Numpy](https://numpy.org), [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [Keras](https://keras.io)) and libraries for data visualization. Currently, I'm continuing to build more skills in working with these libraries by doing researches with my supervisors. The following summer(2021), I hope to complete a research internship program that will provide real-life experience and important technological skills.
